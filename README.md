## Licensing

Bookmarks is licensed under the MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

During development, the plan is to make builds available for free through the [Releases](https://github.com/jbmorley/bookmarks/releases) section of the GitHub project. Once we reach something robust and ready for release, we'll make a paid version available through the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) to fund on-going costs of development. The app will remain Open Source, and anyone is free to contribute or build their own copies, and we'll figure out a way to give free licenses to contributors.
